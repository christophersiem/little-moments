# Automatic Speech-to-Text Transcription

## Context & Problem
Audio-only recordings are difficult to skim, revisit, or reflect on later. Parents need a low-effort way to review captured moments without listening to each recording.

## Goals
- Automatically convert voice recordings into readable text  
- Reduce effort required to revisit past moments  

## Non-Goals
- No manual correction or editing in MVP  
- No semantic analysis or summarization  
- No multilingual support  

## Functional Requirements
- Each saved voice recording is automatically transcribed  
- Transcription starts immediately after saving  
- Transcribed text is linked to the original recording  
- Transcription is displayed in a readable text format  

## Constraints
- Transcription quality must be “good enough,” not perfect  
- System must handle informal, conversational language  

## Success Criteria
- ≥90% of recordings receive a transcription  
- Low number of support requests related to missing or failed transcriptions
