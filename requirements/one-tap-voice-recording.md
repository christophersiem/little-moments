# One-Tap Voice Recording

## Context & Problem
Parents of young children want to capture meaningful everyday moments, but are often tired, distracted, or short on time. Writing or navigating multi-step input flows creates too much friction, causing moments to be lost.

## Goals
- Enable parents to capture moments with minimal effort  
- Make voice the primary input method for the MVP  
- Reduce cognitive load during capture  

## Non-Goals
- No editing or trimming of recordings  
- No background or continuous recording  
- No sharing or exporting  
- No long-form or multi-entry sessions  

## Functional Requirements
- The user can start recording with a single tap  
- The system clearly indicates when recording is active  
- Recording duration is limited to 30–60 seconds  
- The user can stop recording manually  
- After stopping, the recording is saved automatically  

## Constraints
- Must work reliably on mobile devices  
- Must require no prior configuration  
- Must handle short, informal speech  

## Success Criteria
- ≥60% of onboarded users create at least one recording  
- Median time from app open to saved recording < 90 seconds  
- Low abandonment rate during recording
